## What Is Plant Tissue Culture?

Plant tissue culture is a collection of techniques used to grow plant cells, tissues, or organs under sterile conditions on a nutrient culture medium. It allows scientists and growers to clone plants efficiently and preserve valuable genetics.

## Why It Matters

Tissue culture enables:
- **Mass propagation** of disease-free plants  
- **Conservation** of rare or endangered species  
- **Uniform quality** for agricultural or ornamental markets  
- **Export-friendly** products through phytosanitary certification

## The Process

1. **Explants Selection** – Small sections of tissue are taken from a parent plant.  
2. **Sterilization** – Explants are sterilized to remove microorganisms.  
3. **Culture Initiation** – Tissues are placed in a growth medium rich in nutrients and hormones.  
4. **Multiplication** – New shoots or roots develop.  
5. **Acclimatization** – The plantlets are transferred to soil conditions gradually.

## Common Applications

- Propagation of bananas, orchids, and ornamental plants  
- Cannabis genetics preservation  
- Rapid production of clean mother plants  
- Biotechnology and genetic research

## Conclusion

Tissue culture is more than a technique—it’s the **foundation of modern plant biotechnology**.  
Whether you are a researcher, nursery operator, or collector, understanding tissue culture opens the door to the future of sustainable plant propagation.
