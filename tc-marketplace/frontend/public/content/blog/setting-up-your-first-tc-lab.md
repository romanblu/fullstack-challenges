# Setting Up Your First Tissue Culture Lab on a Budget

Starting a tissue culture (TC) lab may sound expensive — but it doesn’t have to be.  
With some creativity and an understanding of what truly matters, you can **create a functional, small-scale lab for under $1000** that can still produce professional results.

---

## 🧪 1. Understanding the Core Needs

Before spending money, know **what’s essential**:

- A **sterile environment** for media preparation and transfers  
- Reliable **temperature and light control** for growth  
- **Basic measuring and sterilization equipment**  

You don’t need industrial-grade autoclaves or laminar flow hoods to start. Focus on creating **clean, controlled conditions** with what you can afford.

---

## 🧴 2. Essential Equipment Checklist

Here’s a sample starter setup:

| Category | Equipment | Approx. Cost (USD) |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Sterile Work Area | Still Air Box (DIY) | $50 |
| Heating & Sterilization | Pressure Cooker | $60 |
| Media Preparation | pH Meter, Scales, Beakers | $80 |
| Culture Containers | Baby Food Jars / Plastic Jars | $30 |
| Lighting | LED Grow Light Panel | $60 |
| Growth Area | Plastic Shelf / Mini Greenhouse | $40 |
| Miscellaneous | Alcohol, Gloves, Masks | $50 |

✅ **Total: ~$370 – $500** for a small home-scale setup.

## 🧰 3. Building Your DIY Still Air Box

A still air box (SAB) is the simplest way to maintain sterile conditions for transfers.  

**Materials:**
- Clear plastic storage box (60L or larger)
- Two arm holes (cut out and smooth edges)
- Alcohol spray and paper towels for cleaning

**Steps:**
1. Clean thoroughly with 70% isopropyl alcohol  
2. Work in a room with minimal air movement  
3. Always flame your tools before use  

With good technique, a SAB can achieve near-sterile transfers comparable to laminar flow cabinets.

---

## 🌱 4. Media Preparation

Start with a standard **Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium** or an equivalent formula.  

For beginners:
- Buy pre-mixed MS powder (e.g., from PhytoTech or Himedia)
- Adjust pH to 5.8 before sterilizing
- Add agar (8g/L) and sugar (30g/L)

After sterilization, pour the medium into jars while still hot — but avoid condensation by slightly cooling before sealing.

---

## 💡 5. Lighting and Growth Conditions

Most plant species grow well at:
- **22–26°C** (room temperature)
- **16-hour photoperiod** (LED or fluorescent light)
- Moderate humidity (~60%)

Inexpensive LED panels with 4000–6500K white light are perfectly fine for initial stages.

---

## 📋 6. Starting Cultures

You can start from:
- Shoot tips or nodes (preferred for beginners)
- Seeds (with sterilization)
- Purchased in-vitro explants from labs

Always **label each jar** with species name, date, and medium type to track results.

---

## 🔬 7. Common Problems and Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Contamination | Poor sterilization | Clean SAB, flame tools longer |
| No growth | Wrong medium or temperature | Adjust hormones or light |
| Browning explants | Oxidation | Add activated charcoal or subculture faster |

---

## 🚀 8. Scaling Up

Once your cultures stabilize, you can:
- Add a **laminar flow hood** (~$300–$400)
- Move to **larger media preparation equipment**
- Experiment with **different hormone concentrations** (auxins/cytokinins)

Over time, you can transition your budget lab into a small commercial unit supplying in-vitro plants or explants to researchers and growers.

---

## 🌍 Final Thoughts

Starting small allows you to **learn, experiment, and optimize** before investing heavily.  
Even a basic TC setup teaches you invaluable skills in:
- Aseptic technique  
- Media formulation  
- Plant propagation  

Remember — **innovation doesn’t always require expensive tools**. It starts with curiosity, precision, and consistency.

> “A small, clean, and well-maintained lab is better than an expensive one with poor technique.”
