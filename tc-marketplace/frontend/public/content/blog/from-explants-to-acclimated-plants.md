The **journey of a tissue-cultured plant** is both scientific and rewarding. Each step, from selecting the right explant to hardening the final plant, requires precision and care.

### 🧫 Step 1 — Selecting the Explant
Healthy, disease-free source material is critical. The explant should be young tissue (like shoot tips or leaf segments) with active growth.

### 🧴 Step 2 — Sterilization
Use ethanol and sodium hypochlorite to remove surface contaminants. Rinse thoroughly with sterile water to prevent tissue damage.

### 🧬 Step 3 — Multiplication
Transfer sterilized explants into nutrient-rich media containing cytokinins. Within weeks, multiple shoots begin to form from a single tissue piece.

### 🌿 Step 4 — Rooting
Once shoots develop, auxin hormones are added to the media to encourage strong root formation.

### 🌤️ Step 5 — Acclimatization
Move plantlets from sterile media to soil or coco peat under high humidity. Gradually expose them to ambient air and light to strengthen them for outdoor growth.

The result: **genetically identical, healthy, and pest-free plants** — ready for sale, trade, or field planting.

Tissue culture offers a sustainable way to scale rare species, ornamental plants, and crops efficiently across global markets.
